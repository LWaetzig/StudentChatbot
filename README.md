### Text Extraktion Model


### Semantic Chunking
In order to improve the way how the text is splitted, we implemented a different approach. This approach tries to identifies chunk points based in semantics. Further explanaition and code can be found [here]()

### Models
- we tested three models using a open source lecture set from MIT -> [Lecture Notes](data/test_lecture_set.pdf)
- The Models are:
  - [Falcon-7B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct)
  - [FLAN-T5-xxl](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl)
  - [DistilBERT finetuned on SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad)
- Models are compaired and evaluated based on the following categories
- Evaluation and test results can be found [here]()
